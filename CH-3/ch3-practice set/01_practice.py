''' 1. Write a python program to display a user entered name followed by Good
 Afternoon using input () function.'''

name = input("Enter your name:")
# print("Good afternoon",name)
print(f"Good afternoon {name}")  # this is "f string function" it helps to add a variable into the string.  much better than before print option. to use f string always make sure you write f before starting the syntax
